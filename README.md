# 🪑 Lisbon Chairs Shop - Next.js & CSS

Welcome to the **Lisbon Chairs Shop** project! 🏬🪑 This is a personal project aimed at improving my **design skills** by following essential typography and layout rules. The web page is built using **Next.js** and **CSS**, ensuring a modern and responsive design.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **CSS** - Styling the webpage with a focus on clean and elegant design.
- **Google Fonts** - Using well-known and readable typefaces.

## 🎯 Project Goals

✅ Improve my **UI/UX design** skills.  
✅ Experiment with **typography, spacing, and layout** principles.  
✅ Follow best practices for **web readability and aesthetics**.  
✅ Create a visually appealing **Lisbon chair shop** webpage.  

## 📖 Design Rules Followed

This project is based on **9 typography and layout rules**, including:

1. **Use good & popular typefaces** (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Playfair Display).  
2. **Limit font choices** to 1-2 typefaces for consistency.  
3. **Choose appropriate font sizes & weights** (16px-32px for text, bold headlines).  
4. **Ensure good reading experience** (max 75 characters per line, proper line height).  
5. **Adjust letter spacing** for better visual appeal.  
6. **Use all caps sparingly** for short titles.  
7. **Avoid justified text** to maintain readability.  
8. **Left-align most text** instead of centering large blocks.  
9. **Follow color contrast best practices** (covered in future improvements).
